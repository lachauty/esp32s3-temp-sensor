Temperature Alert Senior Design Project

Introduction

In research environments such as chemical laboratories, biological labs, and hospitals, maintaining strict temperature control is vital for the preservation of temperature-sensitive samples. These facilities ofter rely on ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezers, which operate around -80 °C to ensure that experimental specimens are sustained for long periods of time.

While many labs use backup power systems to keep freezers operational during power outages, these systems can fail due to human error during maintenence (e.g. forgetting to turn the generator back on). A failure in temperature monitoring or alerting can result in the loss of irreplaceable biological samples and research data.

Our project addresses this problem by developing a temperature monitoring and alert system that continuously samples temperature data from ULT freezers and send real-time alerts when readings go out of the acceptable range. The goal is to provide laboratory personnel with a reliable and automate early-warning system, reducing the risk of catastrophic sample loss.

Approach

In the starting processes of researching components and investigating software based solutions to designing a notification system, the main issues identified was 

- The method of sending notifications to the user
- Our transmission medium
- Our sensor
- How to handle our inputs & outputs
